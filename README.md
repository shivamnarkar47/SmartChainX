# 🚛 SmartChainX: Supply Chain Route & Demand Optimizer

**Consulting-style project** to improve supply chain precision using machine learning, optimization, and data visualization.

---

## 📦 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Demand Forecasting
- Collect data (sales history, regions, product categories)
- Train ML model to predict 7/30 day demand
- Output: Forecast CSV + visual plots

### 🛣️ Phase 2: Route Optimization
- Use TSP/Graph-based model to optimize delivery paths
- Input: warehouse to customer coordinates
- Output: Shortest route map

### 🧮 Phase 3: Inventory Planning
- Based on demand + route delays
- Suggest stock amounts per region
- Output: Inventory plan per location

### 📊 Phase 4: Dashboard & UI
- Streamlit or React dashboard
- Visualize demand, routes, costs

### 📄 Phase 5: Report Generator
- Generate executive PDF summary with key KPIs
